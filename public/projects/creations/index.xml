      <description>In late 2017, the Pacific Post Partum Support Society (PPPSS) conducted a trial texting support program to measure the impact of providing post partum support through text message interactions.

      <description>More info on its way! Feeny Technology Solutions was a boutique technology coaching and IT company I started as a teenager specializing in one-on-one technology consulting, guidance and support for individuals and small businesses. I purposesly kept my client list small in order to provide a very dedicated, close relationship with my customers. This also ensured the business did not distract from my day job as a software engineer and eventual technology leader.</description>
