      <description>The success of our launch of Lendesk&amp;rsquo;s Lender Network, a platform that allows licensed mortgage brokerages to file applications directly to lenders, was proving to be attractive to mortgage brokers. We signed a SOW of work to provide RBC&amp;rsquo;s alternative lending division an integration with their traditional mortgage platform division&amp;rsquo;s LINK system. This integration automatically ingested mortgage applications from customers that were referred to RBC&amp;rsquo;s alternative mortgage specialists. Those specialists could then take advantage of Lendesk&amp;rsquo;s mortgage workflow platform and effortlessly submit those applications to Lendesk&amp;rsquo;s Lender Network, including Scotiabank, First National, CMLS, Equitable Bank, and the Paradigm Quest group of lenders.</description>
