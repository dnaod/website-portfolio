[{"categories":null,"contents":"In late 2017, the Pacific Post Partum Support Society (PPPSS) conducted a trial texting support program to measure the impact of providing post partum support through text message interactions. What was discovered was that phone support metrics did not change and a new demographic of parents were taking advantage of the service - a group of people who were previously not being given the support they needed through a difficult time in their lives.\nPPPSS undertook the process of getting a grant from the Province to provide this service as part of its regular offering. I was approached and asked to assess a software platform solution that would make this possible. Through a series of meetings, we established our requirements and budget.\nI proceeeded to evaluate a series of platforms that would fulfill our needs and presented my findings to the society. We decided on a platform called iCarol. I participated in the contract negotiations, acting on PPPSS\u0026rsquo;s behalf as their technical expert and was able to leverage the contract negoatiation skills with platform vendors that I practiced in my day job.\nNext was the process of setting up the platform for our needs, which I took on, followed by the training of the trainers for full deployment to the society\u0026rsquo;s staff and wonderful volunteers. Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s always bumps and I helped smooth those out. I\u0026rsquo;m proud to say we\u0026rsquo;ve been offering texting support for those in need since February 2019.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/creations/icarol-sms/","tags":["techtags","used","in","website"],"title":"Text Support Solution for the Pacific Post Partum Support Society"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Feeny Technology Solutions was a boutique technology coaching and IT company I started as a teenager specializing in one-on-one technology consulting, guidance and support for individuals and small businesses.

We signed a SOW of work to provide RBC\u0026rsquo;s alternative lending division an integration with their traditional mortgage platform division\u0026rsquo;s LINK system. This integration automatically ingested mortgage applications from customers that were referred to RBC\u0026rsquo;s alternative mortgage specialists. Those specialists could then take advantage of Lendesk\u0026rsquo;s mortgage workflow platform and effortlessly submit those applications to Lendesk\u0026rsquo;s Lender Network, including Scotiabank, First National, CMLS, Equitable Bank, and the Paradigm Quest group of lenders. Brokers would be able to securely pull credit from Equifax and TransUnion and then submit their files seamlessly.\nLendesk had never taken on a project of this size. Through a series of on-site meetings in Toronto with RBC, the working group, with me playing a major part as VP of Engineering, established a set of agreed upon requirements. Those requirements were brought back to Lendesk for the next steps of the project. With experience delivering projects of this size, I organized and led a week-long workshop breaking down those requirements into high-level epics, identifying risks and capturing assumptions, making high-level architecture decisions, and estimating the length of the project with the other senior Product and Engineering leaders across all teams. This was a company-wide high-stakes project for Lendesk and our first major win with one of Big 5 Canadian financial institutions.\nAnd so began a 7 month project for RBC in parallel with Lendesk\u0026rsquo;s ongoing Lender networking integration expansion and SMB brokerage products. I continued to work hands-on with the participating teams mitigating risk, making design decisions, liasing between RBC and Lendesk, maintaining the quality of the output, managing the Directors and Leads, and communicating our progress.\nUser Acceptance tests began in late November with a successful outcome. And in the new year, RBC went live with their new alternative mortgage platform. On-time and on-budget. Because of the success of this enterprise sized project, we were soon in discussions with CIBC for a similar solution.\nToday, Lendesk provides solutions to 4 of the 5 big banks in Canada, who are using their Digital Solutions for Financial Institutions. And Lendesk now offers the leading \u0026ldquo;plug-and-play\u0026rdquo; digital mortgage experience for brokerages, big banks, and credit unions in Canada.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/contributions/rbc-ams/","tags":["Ruby / Rails","React","postGRES","AWS"],"title":"RBC Alternate Mortgage System"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I led the team responsible for developing Ivanhoe Cambridge\u0026rsquo;s new loyalty and gift card program.

Growing the team to 4 members, we focused on the areas of build management, branch management, version management, and release management. Our achievements included:\nWrangling multiple branches of source code across multiple teams with varying feature sets into a single, organized set of branches representing our software lifecycle process stages. Creating a TeamCity QuickBuild (and then Jenkins) -based distributed build system with spare hardware to reduce the 144 target total build time for all components from a week to 36 hours. Engaging with Development teams and creating documentation for training and standards of build system standards, and contracts aligning all teams to use the automated build systems, versioning systems, and processes surrounding branching and merging. As our processes matured, I also took on team management of a new Lua script-based test automation team that was reducing testing effort and testing timelines as our games library scaled. When ready for prime-time, the new test automation platform was integrated into the automated build and reporting system. This reduced the amount of time for autoamted testing results to be delivered to the teams, and decreased the number of errors that were deployed to production.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/contributions/rocket-build/","tags":["Jenkins","Ant/Nant","distributed computing"],"title":"Rocket Builds"},{"categories":null,"contents":"More detail of the actual gaming server on its way!\nRed Hawk Gaming was a company contracted by the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma owned Rocket Gaming Systems. Rocket was an indigenous owned company that built casino games and systems sold and installed to casino operators throughout the U.S. Red Hawk developed all the software for Rocket in its Vancouver office while hardware was developed in Rocket\u0026rsquo;s Grove, Oklahoma office.\nI joined the team responsible for developing the C++ based server software. At the time of joining, taxation laws for casino profits were in a state of flux and Red Hawk was creating a new style of gaming server based on a Bingo game behind the scenes but still presenting a user experience that matched the traditional slots game. This \u0026ldquo;Class 3\u0026rdquo; gaming would have a more favourable tax structure ensuring more profits went to indigenous community development.\nClass 3 Community gaming meant that multiple players must join and participate in the same game. This required creating a distributed system when players pressed the spin button, they joined a virtual lobby connecting multiple players within the same casino until the player threshold was met and the game could proceed. If that threshold was not met, the player would then be added to a lobby across multiple casinos attempting to meet that threshold. When the players\u0026rsquo; bingo cards were registered with the game, a virtual ball caller would draw balls until one or more winners was found and prizes were distributed - often as another entertaining meta-game.\nMid-project, the senior engineer responsible for this new Class 3 gaming system left the company with many aspects of the distributed networking and virtual ball caller algorithm incomplete. I took over as lead developer. I refactored and completed the project, and worked directly with gaming regulators, including travelling to the U.S., to certify our new random number generator and gaming server. Rocket Gaming was awarded the first Class 3 gaming license of this form in the U.S.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/contributions/class-3-gaming-server/","tags":["C++","Windows"],"title":"A Casino-wide Multiplayer Class 3 Gaming Server for Slot Machines"},{"categories":null,"contents":"In 2000, mobile data technology was just beginning to sprout in the business world. Microsoft was working on Windows Mobile while Palm were the darling of keyboard warriors. Before desktop VPN standards had made the jump to mobile devices, Infowave was ahead of its time creating connectors that gave mobile devices access to companies\u0026rsquo; resources with their firewalls - extending applications previously only available while on-site to the mobile workers of the world.\nWhen the Gen2 project came to an end, I was asked to join a R\u0026amp;D team creating prototypes for future Infowave products focused on experimenting with mobile services that did not yet exist. During this time, I created a prototype server which would allow mobile device users to view Microsoft Office documents they received in their email. At the time, mobile devices could not view Office documents natively and this service allowed any device. A user would forward the email to a predetermined email address and a server would extract the Office document, convert that document to HTML, and publish it on a web server. The user would receive an email with a custom unique link, protected by their enterprise credentials, that they could navigate to with their mobile browser or WAP browser, allowing users to finally view Office documents on early mobile devices. This prototype was created with Microsoft Server, Microsoft C++, Office OLE Automation.\nAn AI generated picture of what a WAP -enabled phone may have displayed. Remember, this was a time when there was no way to view a Microsoft Office document on a mobile device.\nA litte more about my time at Infowave\u0026hellip;\nThe first team I joined was a partnership between Infowave and Intel (called Gen2) working on porting Infowave\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise Connector on a prototype mobile device intended for future market release. This incredible device was way ahead of its time. Based on a Gentoo linux platform and bleeding-edge 800x600 screen equipped with a stylus in a form factor similar to a Game Boy Advance. I was responsible for porting Infowave\u0026rsquo;s Enterprise Connector components to that platform. This involved many cross-company meetings with Intel and weekly travel from Vancouver to Hillsborough, Oregon for collaborative work.\nAt one point during the project, Intel was dissatisfied with the effort level to build and install the product consistenly, threatening to end their relationship with Infowave. In response, myself and another other developer took over those responsibilities working 72 hours straight, organizing and creating a repeatable and consistent build and install process. Thus salvaging the relationship and contract for Infowave.\nAnd then began the early 2000s tech crash and Infowave began a long series of restructurings. During this time and sadly only for a short time, i was transferred to a team where I was responsible for the Installshield based installer.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/contributions/msoffice-mobile-web/","tags":["C++","Office OLE Automation","WAP","HTML"],"title":"Office Doc Attachments Display Service for Early Mobile Web Devices"},{"categories":null,"contents":"More detail on its way!\nThe Canada Arm 2 project was a robotic arm installed on the International Space Station. It remains in operation today performing a variety of tasks from loading and unloading cargo modules to assisting extra vehicular activities by astronauts during station maintenance tasks. MDA was responsible for the command and control software that drove the 3 major pieces of the arm: the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), Mobile Base System (MBS), and Special Purpose Dextrous Manipulator (SPDM but later renamed \u0026ldquo;Dextre\u0026rdquo;).\nI had 3 roles during my tenure at MDA. I first acted as a test member creating test scripts for our automated test system. During this time, I led a team of 2 as we enhanced and extended the test suite. Once a defect was found, we debugged the Ada code to correct the source code and submit the fixes.\nI also debugged and validated the self-diagnostic assembly source code written. I discovered a critical defect which would have corrupted the command and control software completely, leading to a complete shutdown of the arm operations.\nLastly, I wrote the code for a subcomponent of the MBS called the Payload Orbital Accomodator (POA). This was a docking port on the MBS where the SSRMS could attach payload modules. Once a payload was attached to the POA, the Power Data Grapple Fixure (PDGF) would apply power and data to the payload for the collection of sensor data and application of heating - protecting the payload from the brutal space environment.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/contributions/mbs-poa/","tags":["Ada83/Ada95","Unix","6086 assembly"],"title":"Canada Arm 2's Mobile Base System Payload Orbital Accomodator"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/contact/","tags":null,"title":"Dan Feeny"}]
