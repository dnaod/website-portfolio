Feeny Technology Solutions was a boutique technology coaching and IT company I started as a teenager specializing in one-on-one technology consulting, guidance and support for individuals and small businesses.\nIn 2018, FTS shut down so that I could focus my off-time on my role at the Pacific Post Partum Support Society.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/creations/feeny-tech/","tags":["IT"],"title":"Feeny Technology Solutions"},{"categories":null,"contents":"More detail on its way!\nThe Canada Arm 2 project was a robotic arm installed on the International Space Station. It remains in operation today performing a variety of tasks from loading and unloading cargo modules to assisting extra vehicular activities by astronauts during station maintenance tasks. MDA was responsible for the command and control software that drove the 3 major pieces of the arm: the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), Mobile Base System (MBS), and Special Purpose Dextrous Manipulator (SPDM but later renamed \u0026ldquo;Dextre\u0026rdquo;).\nI had 3 roles during my tenure at MDA. I first acted as a test member creating test scripts for our automated test system. During this time, I led a team of 2 as we enhanced and extended the test suite. Once a defect was found, we debugged the Ada code to correct the source code and submit the fixes.\nI also debugged and validated the self-diagnostic assembly source code written. I discovered a critical defect which would have corrupted the command and control software completely, leading to a complete shutdown of the arm operations.\nLastly, I wrote the code for a subcomponent of the MBS called the Payload Orbital Accomodator (POA). This was a docking port on the MBS where the SSRMS could attach payload modules. Once a payload was attached to the POA, the Power Data Grapple Fixure (PDGF) would apply power and data to the payload for the collection of sensor data and application of heating - protecting the payload from the brutal space environment.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/contributions/mbs-poa/","tags":["Ada83/Ada95","Unix","6086 assembly"],"title":"Canada Arm 2's Mobile Base System Payload Orbital Accomodator"},{"categories":null,"contents":"More detail on its way!\nRed Hawk Gaming was a company contracted by the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma owned Rocket Gaming Systems. Rocket was an indigenous owned company that built casino games and systems sold and installed to casino operators throughout the U.S. Red Hawk developed all the software for Rocket in its Vancouver office while hardware was developed in Rocket\u0026rsquo;s Grove, Oklahoma office.\nI joined the team responsible for developing the C++ based server software. At the time of joining, taxation laws for casino profits were in a state of flux and Red Hawk was creating a new style of gaming server based on a Bingo game behind the scenes but still presenting a user experience that matched the traditional slots game. This \u0026ldquo;Class 3\u0026rdquo; gaming would have a more favourable tax structure ensuring more profits went to indigenous community development.\nClass 3 Community gaming meant that multiple players must join and participate in the same game. This required creating a distributed system when players pressed the spin button, they joined a virtual lobby connecting multiple players within the same casino until the player threshold was met and the game could proceed. If that threshold was not met, the player would then be added to a lobby across multiple casinos attempting to meet that threshold. When the players\u0026rsquo; bingo cards were registered with the game, a virtual ball caller would draw balls until one or more winners was found and prizes were distributed - often as another entertaining meta-game.\nMid-project, the senior engineer responsible for this new Class 3 gaming system left the company with many aspects of the distributed networking and virtual ball caller algorithm incomplete. I took over as lead developer. I refactored and completed the project, and worked directly with gaming regulators, including travelling to the U.S., to certify our new random number generator and gaming server. Rocket Gaming was awarded the first Class 3 gaming license of this form in the U.S.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/contributions/class-3-gaming-server/","tags":["C++","Windows"],"title":"A Casino-wide Multiplayer Class 3 Gaming Server for Slot Machines"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/contact/","tags":null,"title":"Dan Feeny"}]
