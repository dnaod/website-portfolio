In late 2017, the Pacific Post Partum Support Society (PPPSS) conducted a trial texting support program to measure the impact of providing post partum support through text message interactions.  What was discovered was that phone support metrics did not change and a new demographic of parents were taking advantage of the service - a group of people who were previously not being given the support they needed through a difficult time in their lives.

PPPSS undertook the process of getting a grant from the Province to provide this service as part of its regular offering.  I was approached and asked to assess a software platform solution that would make this possible.  Through a series of meetings, we established our requirements and budget.

I proceeeded to evaluate a series of platforms that would fulfill our needs and presented my findings to the society.  We decided on a platform called [iCarol](https://www.icarol.com/).  I participated in the contract negotiations, acting on PPPSS's behalf as their technical expert and was able to leverage the contract negoatiation skills with platform vendors that I practiced in my day job.

Next was the process of setting up the platform for our needs, which I took on, followed by the training of the trainers for full deployment to the society's staff and wonderful volunteers.  Of course, there's always bumps and I helped smooth those out.  I'm proud to say we've been offering texting support for those in need since February 2019.
