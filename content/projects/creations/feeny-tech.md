Feeny Technology Solutions was a boutique technology coaching and IT company I started as a teenager specializing in one-on-one technology consulting, guidance and support for individuals and small businesses.  I purposesly kept my client list small in order to provide a very dedicated, close relationship with my customers.  This also ensured the business did not distract from my day job as a software engineer and eventual technology leader.

Respecting some of my residential customers' privacy, some of my customers included:
* High school teachers
* Retired Provincial Government professionals
* Healthcare professionals
* Resolutionary Electronic Systems
* Effortless Electronics
* and more...

In 2018, FTS shut down so that I could focus my off-time on my role at the Pacific Post Partum Support Society.
