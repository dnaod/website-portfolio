Feeny Technology Solutions was a boutique technology coaching and IT company I started as a teenager specializing in one-on-one technology consulting, guidance and support for individuals and small businesses.

In 2018, FTS shut down so that I could focus my off-time on my role at the Pacific Post Partum Support Society.
