The success of our launch of Lendesk's Lender Network, a platform that allows licensed mortgage brokerages to file applications directly to lenders, was proving to be attractive to mortgage brokers.  We signed a statement of work to provide RBC's alternative lending division an integration with their traditional mortgage platform (LINK).  This integration automatically ingested mortgage applications from customers that were referred to RBC's alternative mortgage specialists.  Those specialists could then take advantage of Lendesk's mortgage workflow platform and effortlessly submit those applications to Lendesk's Lender Network, including Scotiabank, First National, CMLS, Equitable Bank, and the Paradigm Quest group of lenders. Brokers would be able to securely pull credit from Equifax and TransUnion and then submit their files seamlessly.

Lendesk had never taken on a project of this size.  Through a series of on-site meetings in Toronto with RBC, the working group, with me playing a major part as VP of Engineering, established a set of agreed upon requirements.  Those requirements were brought back to Lendesk for the next steps of the project.  With experience delivering projects of this size, I organized and led a week-long workshop breaking down those requirements into high-level epics, identifying risks and capturing assumptions, making high-level architecture decisions, and estimating the length of the project with the other senior Product and Engineering leaders across all teams.  This was a company-wide high-stakes project for Lendesk and our first major win with one of Big 5 Canadian financial institutions.

And so began a 7 month project for RBC in parallel with Lendesk's ongoing Lender networking integration expansion and SMB brokerage products.  I continued to work hands-on with the participating teams mitigating risk, making design decisions, liasing between RBC and Lendesk, maintaining the quality of the output, managing the Directors and Leads, and communicating our progress.

User Acceptance tests began in late November with a successful outcome.  And in the new year, RBC went live with their new alternative mortgage platform.  On-time and on-budget.  Because of the success of this enterprise sized project, we were soon in discussions with CIBC for a similar solution.

Today, Lendesk provides solutions to 4 of the 5 big banks in Canada, who are using their Digital Solutions for Financial Institutions.  And Lendesk now offers the leading "plug-and-play" digital mortgage experience for brokerages, big banks, and credit unions in Canada.
