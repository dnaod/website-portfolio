Kiosk NEXTEP - Our team was challenged to release a tablet-based, self-serve ordering system that could handle the demands of restaurants at the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) airport - and we were asked to do it in a matter of months.  We rose to the challenge.  Building on and enhancing the Mobile ordering system, and creating a brand new tablet ordering interface, we created and deployed the working system to DFW in under 3 months.
