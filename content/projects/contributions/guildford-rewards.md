I led the team responsible for developing Ivanhoe Cambridge's new loyalty and gift card program.  This consisted of payment gateway services, a rule-based payment and rewards engine, an accompanying desktop portal, and mobile apps for Android and iPhone.

We added a number of new-to-Paywith features and platform enhancements for this project including:
- A new simplified onboarding flow on the web and mobile apps
- An SMS-based sign-up flow
- Rewards campaigns - time-bound loyalty and rewards rules
- A set of new discounts and rebates rules requested by Ivanhoe Cambridge (owner of Guildford Towne Centre)
- Welcome gifts on sign-up
- A new rules-based offer engine service
- A new rules-based communication service
- The introduction of multi-factor authentication (SMS-based)
