INETCO Analytics was a green-field project using INETCO Insight's firehose of real-time, financial transactional data to gain valuable and actionable insights to grow your business.  Boeing Employee Credit Union (BECU) was one of the first customers to deploy this new product.  This product helped Boeing:
- Deliver an exceptional member experience through a deepened understanding of ATM usage and improved responsiveness — Achieved a 78.9% ATM Net Promoter Score and a 9.28 ATM satisfaction score in 2019
- Reduce cash replenishment costs — Striving for 80% cash utilization at each ATM
- Make better ATM placement and lease renewal decisions — up to 88% faster

More details of how INETCO's full product suite helped BECU can be [found here](https://www.inetco.com/resources/case-studies/how-becu-improves-member-experience-with-real-time-atm-transaction-intelligence/).

 Here's a great visual of what we built and the technologies we used.

While we spent most of our time in the backing technologies, the visualizations were the result of a partnership with the [Vancouver Institute of Visual Analytics](http://viva.sfu.ca/).  We consulted and brought on-site a team of talented UI Design Consultants.  The outcome was a set of beautiful, informative dashboards for managing your ATM fleet.
