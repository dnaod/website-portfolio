I was a guest lecturer at Kwantlet Polytechnic University for the Technical Management and Services Program's TMAS5110 - "Managing Technical Business Growth.  I presented a lecture and discussion on "Leadership Styles" that I had originally created the Tribe Leadership Collaboration Group.

After the topic drew to a close, I invited the class to ask questions about the Tech Industry in general which led to some great discussions with potential future leaders of Vancouver Tech scene.
