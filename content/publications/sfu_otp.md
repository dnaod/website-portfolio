I was invited to represent Infowave's partnership SFU's Object Technology Program class of 2002.  I spoke to the students of that year's program in an auditorium about what they could expect day-to-day in a software engineering job and answered any questions they may have had.  This partnership also provided another source of candidates for hiring in a difficult market.

I was also asked to review the curriculum and was able to provide feedback on missing elements - specifically SCM concepts: Source Control, Build Management, Version Management, and Configuration Management.
